About us
======
Designtalk(c) was created by a driven few in the design community, wanting to help other designers and to generally create a environment for designer to talk.

You're very welcome to register, ask questions, discuss or answer questions outright. 

Rules:

1. Keep to the subject. Questions not regarding design will be removed

2. We promote a constructive mindset at Designtalk. While constructive criticism is the foundation of this site, destructive or shaming criticism has no place here.

3. Enjoy!
